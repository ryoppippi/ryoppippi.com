**Bun** is a really nice JavaScript tool!  
I really love it.

One of the cool things in Bun is the aspect of package manager.  
`bun install` is extreamly fast.

Bun uses a unique lockfile called `Bun.lockb`.  
This is like `package-lock.json` in `npm`.
This binary lockfile speeds up the installation process.

However, because of the binary format, you cannot see the content of `Bun.lockb` directly.
This is a little bit inconvenient.

## For VSCode Users

You can just install [the official extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oven.bun-vscode) and it works.

## For Vim/Neovim Users

There is no official plugin for Vim/Neovim.  
So, let's make it by ourselves!

In fact, bun has outputs `Bun.lock` in yarn v1 format by:

```sh
bun bun.lockb
```

So, we can utilize this feature!

Let's write a simple vim plugin that automatically runs `bun bun.lockb` when you open `Bun.lockb` file.


### Lua Version
If you are using Neovim, you can write in Lua:
```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufReadCmd", {
    pattern = "bun.lockb",
    callback = function(ev)
        -- get the absolute path of the current file
        local path = vim.fn.expand("%:p")
        -- run command 'bun ' .. path and get stdout
        local output = vim.fn.systemlist("bun " .. path)
        -- set output to current buffer
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, -1, true, output)
        -- set filetype to yarn.lock
        vim.opt_local.filetype = "conf"
        -- set readonly
        vim.opt_local.readonly = true
        -- set nomodifiable
        vim.opt_local.modifiable = false
    end,
})
```

### Vim Script Version
Also, Vim Script is great because both Vim and Neovim can use it!

```vimscript
if exists("g:loaded_bun_lock")
    finish
endif

let g:loaded_bun_lock = 1

augroup BunLockb
    autocmd!
    autocmd BufReadCmd bun.lockb
        \ let path = expand("%:p") |
        \ let output = systemlist("bun " . path) |
        \ call setline(1, output) |
        \ setlocal filetype=conf |
        \ setlocal readonly |
        \ setlocal nomodifiable
augroup END
```

I make them to [a plugin](https://github.com/ryoppippi/vim-bun-lock), so you can just install it in your way!

**Enjoy!**
