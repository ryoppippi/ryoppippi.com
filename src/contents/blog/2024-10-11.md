I recently started to use [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) in my projects and I'm really enjoying it.

One of my favorite feautres is [`shortcuts`](https://unocss.dev/config/shortcuts) and [`rules`](https://unocss.dev/config/rules).
Shorcurts allows us to define a single shorthand for a set of multiple classes. For example, instead of writing `class="p-4 m-4 bg-gray-100 text-gray-900"` we can write `class="card"`.
Rules allows us to define a set of classes that should be applied to a specific element. It is really useful when we create complicated rules.

I created a library, [`@ryoppippi/unocss-preset`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/unocss-preset), which includes my opinionated shortcuts and rules.

I'd like to share some of them.

> [!WARNING]
> Using too-short shortcuts can make your code less readable. So, be careful when you create your own shortcuts.

## `flex` shortcuts

You may have confused that `items-center` and `justify-center` before.
`items-center` is for vertical alignment and `justify-center` is for horizontal alignment.
When we set margin, we can use `mx-` for horizontal margin and `my-` for vertical margin.
So, I created a shortcut for `flex` based on this naming rules.

```ts
const shortcuts = {
	fxc: 'flex justify-center',
	fxs: 'flex justify-start',
	fxe: 'flex justify-end',
	fyc: 'flex items-center',
	fys: 'flex items-start',
	fye: 'flex items-end',
	fcc: 'flex items-center justify-center',
};
```

## `grid` shortcuts

I also created a shortcut for `grid`.

You can centerise the content using `grid` and `place-content-center`! This is easy. Also, you can use `place-items-center` to centerise multiple items.

```ts
const shortcuts = {
	gc: 'grid place-content-center',
	gcc: 'gc place-items-center',
};
```

I'll add more shortcuts. When I add new shortcuts, I'll write a new post.

So, see you next time!
