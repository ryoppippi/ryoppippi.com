I stayed in Tokyo from October 16th to November 4th, 2025.
Here's what I did.

# What I Did

## 5 Talks

### [Claude Code Meetup Tokyo](https://aiau.connpass.com/event/369265/)

Over 300 people attended in person, and more than 1000 people watched the live stream.
I decided to come to Japan for this event. I was happy to meet so many people.

### [Work≠Build Meetup feat ryoppippi](https://wnb.connpass.com/event/371722/)

A meetup where I gathered people I wanted to talk with and let them speak freely. I wasn't feeling 100%, so I didn't speak much, but everyone else's talks were really interesting. The panel discussion with this group was great.

### [Vimconf 2025 Small LT](https://vimconf.org/2025/ja/)

I hadn't planned to attend, but I extended my Tokyo stay by a week, so it became possible. Since I was going anyway, I decided to give a talk. The regular talk proposals were already closed, so I applied for an LT slot and got accepted. I had to create a plugin from scratch. The result was about a 3-minute LT, but the effort was way more than 3 minutes lol. (At the after-party, {@mopp} asked me why I didn't apply for a regular talk slot. Honestly, I wanted to talk more.)

I was able to buy all of these despite limited stock. I was really happy.

## Meeting People

This year, in addition to the usual vim-jp folks, I was able to meet many OSS developers and people I interact with on Twitter.
As always, on the last night of my Japan stay, we all went out for dinner together, and this time over 10 people from {@vim-jp} gathered.
Below are a few picks from what was posted on Twitter.

# Misc

- I definitely overpacked my schedule.
  - Even though I was there for 3 weeks, I basically never left the Yamanote line area. My schedule was too packed.
  - The only times I went outside the Yamanote line were when I went to Mitaka for business and to Tokorozawa to watch Kagaribi - just twice.
  - I wanted to go to Osaka... and Nikko too.
  - It was a holiday, but I didn't really relax.
  - My schedule was pretty much full from morning to night. What even is a breakfast appointment? lol
  - Well, it was incredibly fun, so it's all good.
- I met a British person I first met 3 years ago. We hadn't seen each other for a year, and they said "You've gained confidence, you're completely different from before." I was happy to hear that. Several other people said similar things.
- In the past six months, I've talked more with engineers and various people online, so I was happy to meet everyone in person.
- I'm so glad that even though I decided to come to Japan so suddenly, everyone made time to meet me.
- I went to Niwa-no-Yu in Nerima and it was really comfortable. I want to go again.
- I was happy to be pampered, but I also felt that `ccusage` is near the end of its life, so I need to work hard on the next product. But I got various ideas, so I'm grateful.
